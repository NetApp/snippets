## Overview

A "snippet" of code can be loosely defined code that is meant to teach you one way to 
use other libraries and applications, or tie them together to solve a particular problem.

**SNIPPET:**
Examples of what would be a "snippet":
* Powershell script which makes use of the NetApp Powershell Toolkit
* Python or Bash based script that assists with customer demonstration or reference
architecture deployments with NetApp technology

**NOT A SNIPPET:**
Examples of what would not be a "snippet":
* Complete or nearly complete code that could easily be a library on its own
* Standalone application solving complete sets of problems
